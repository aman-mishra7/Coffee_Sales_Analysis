# Coffee Sales Data Analysis

## Abstract
This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of coffee sales data to identify purchasing trends, sales patterns, and customer preferences. The dataset covers transactions over a specific time period and includes various types of coffee sold. The goal is to leverage exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights such as peak sales periods, top-selling products, and patterns in customer purchasing behavior. Ultimately, this analysis seeks to provide actionable insights for improving inventory management, sales strategies, and customer satisfaction.

## Tools
### Jupyter Notebook:
- Python was used for the entire analysis workflow, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- Libraries such as Pandas were used for handling data manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn were employed for creating insightful visualizations.
